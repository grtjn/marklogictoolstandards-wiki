Welcome to the MarkLogic Tool Standards wiki!

This project aims to provide useful standards, best practices, and guidance around laying out applications that target MarkLogic. This will allow all the open source deploy tools (Roxy, mjlsadmin, ml-gradle et al) to use the same source application folder layouts - providing consistency amongst all application deployments. 

This will allow developers to choose their favourite tools safe in the knowledge that the same distributed application will work with their preferred toolset. 

## Standards

- [Application Foldering Layout](Foldering)
- [Target Environment Configuration Files](ConfigFiles)
- [Deploy Tool Tasks](DeployTasks)
